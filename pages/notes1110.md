## group work

on [homework 2](https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools/coursedata/tree/master/hw2-datamerge), due tomorrow

- Work in groups of 3 ideally, groups of 2 or 4 are fine too,
  and reshuffling groups during class is fine.
- Please change place to work with people you have not worked with before:
  great way to learn more, even if's a bit uncomfortable at first.
- Solve your errors and road blocks and questions with peers.  
  If you have solved them already, help someone else solve theirs,
  or discuss someone else's solution to discover other strategies.
- keep engaged and productive
