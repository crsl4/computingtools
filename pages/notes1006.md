## homework

due T 10/11: do and [submit](https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools/coursedata#commit-push-and-submit-your-work)
exercise 3 from [homework 1](https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools/coursedata/tree/master/hw1-snaqTimeTests).
The goal of this exercise is to write a shell script with
search/replace components, with a loop
and with test statements (for, if/then).

## shell scripts

### script arguments

command-line arguments stored in variables `$1`, `$2`, etc.  
`$0`: name of script
`$#`: number of arguments

example: script to show both the beginning and
the end of a file.
argument: file name  
create a new file `headtail.sh` containing this:

```shell
echo "script name: $0"
echo "first argument: $1"
echo "number of arguments: $#"
(head -n 2; tail -n 2) < "$1"
```

by the way: `<` redirect the standard input, and  
subshell between `(  )`: both head and tail get the same standard input.  
execute the script like this (for now):

```shell
bash headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed
bash headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed | column -t
```

### safe options and permissions

always start your script with this:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
set -e # script terminates if any command exits with non-zero status
set -u # terminates if any variable is unset
set -o pipefail # terminates if command within a pipes exits unsuccessfully
```

`#!` "shebang": tells how to run the script.
Would be `#!/usr/bin/perl` for a perl script.
do `which bash` or `which perl` to know what to put on this line:
path to bash or to perl.

With the first line and with the execute permission, we can run the script
with `./myscript.sh filename` instead of `bash myscript.sh filename`.  
To change permission:

```shell
ls -l
chmod u+x headtail.sh
ls -l
./headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed
./headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed | column -t
```

`u`, `g`, `o`: user, group, other; `a` for all  
`+` or `-` to add or remove permissions  
`r`, `w`, `x`: read, write, execute

**~/bin directory**:

- create one if you don't already have one,
  put your own programs there, to call them from anywhere.
- add it to your PATH variable. Do you see it when you do `echo $PATH`?
- if not: edit your file `~/.bash_profile`, add the line
  `export PATH="$PATH:~/bin"`, run `source ~/.bash_profile`
  or simply exit your shell and re-open it.

With that, I can move my script `headtail.sh` into `~/bin`, and run
it from anywhere I would like, as `headtail.sh filename`:

```shell
mv headtail.sh ~/bin/
headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed
headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed | column -t
```

### arithmetic expansion

use `(( ))`. integers only.
If you need anything elaborate, it means that you should use a
Python, Perl or R script, not a shell script.

```shell
i=3678
echo "my variables is: i=$i"
((i = i+6))
echo "I incremented i by 6: now i=$i"
((i--))
echo "I decremented i by 1: now i=$i"
((i++)); echo "I incremented i by 1: now i=$i"
((i+=1)); echo "I incremented i by 1 again: now i=$i"
((i/=5)); echo "finally, I divided i by 5: now i=$i"
echo $((i++))
echo $i # i++ executes the command and increments i after
echo $((++i))
echo $i # ++i increments i first, then executes the command
```

### `if` statements and checks

example:

```shell
if [ $i -lt 800 ] # the spaces after `[` and before `]` are REQUIRED
then
  echo "i is less than 800"
else
  echo "i is not less than 800"
fi
```

headtail script: let's test and check for at least one argument
(file name), and if so, test that this file is readable:

```shell
if [ $# -lt 1 -o ! -f $1 -o ! -r $1 ]
then
  echo "error: no argument, or no file, or file not readable"
  exit 1 # exit script with error code (1). 0 = successful exit
fi
```

exit code: 0 if successful, 1 if unsuccessful (for the shell, 0=true, 1=false!!)

|------|-------------|
| test expressions &nbsp;&nbsp;|             |
|:-----|:------------|
| `-z str` | string `str` is empty |
|`str1 = str2`| strings `str1` and `str2` are identical. different: `str1 != str2` |
|`int1 -eq int2`| integers `int1` and `int2` are equal. not equal: `int1 -ne int2` |
|`int1 -lt int2`| integer int1 is less than int2. greater: `int1 -gt int2` |
|`int1 -le int2`| integer int1 is less than or equal to int2. greater or equal: `int1 -ge int2`|
|`-d thing` | `thing` is a directory. file: `-f`, link: `-h` |
|`-e thing`| `thing` exists |
|`-r file`| `file` is readable. writable: `-w`, executable: `-x`|
|`-o`, `-a`, `!`| or, and, negation |
|`( )`| to group tests |
|--------|------------|
|        |            |
{: rules="groups"}

<!-- `-x`: accessible, if argument is expression -->

short-circuit evaluation: convenient, and *the order is important!*

- "A or B": B is not evaluated if A is true, because
  the result would be true anyway.  
  We can do "zero arguments or argument 1 is a file" without causing
  an error, but there could be an error if we did
  "argument 1 is a file or zero arguments".
- "A or B": B is not evaluated if A is false: the result would be false anyway.


Let's add a second, optional argument to our `headtail.sh` script:
number of lines to show at each end. default: 2

```shell
nl=2 # number of lines to show, on each end
if [ $# -ge 2 ]
then
  nl=$2
fi
(head -n $nl; tail -n $nl) < "$1"
```

and now use our script with (or without) its new option:

```shell
headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed 5 | column -t
headtail.sh Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed   | column -t
```

<!-- add something about bash arrays? -->

## changing your shell prompt

variable PS1 contains your shell prompt (prompt string):

```shell
echo $PS1 # save this output, to go back to original prompt in same session
PS1="hiCecile% "
PS1="hiCecile$ "
PS1="$ "
PS1="\$(parse_git_branch)$ "
PS1="\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)$ "
PS1="\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\]$ "
```

last one: shows if in git repository, and if so,
name of current checked out branch  
to affect future sessions: pick the one you like best and add this at
the end of your `~/.bash_profile` file:
`export PS1=preferred_choice_here`
